;;; Commentary:

;; This is a collection of simple utility functions for Scheme
;; programming. It was born when the present author noticed that he
;; used almost none of the functions offered in quack.el by Neil W.
;; Van Dyke.

;;; Code:

;; This needs to be loaded, as we overwrite their `run-scheme'
