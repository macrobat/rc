T 1326643867 18<29dutchfish>	inashdeen, architecture as i understand is related to which processor you run, ie i386, amd64 and so on. The kind of install you want ie dekstop and which packages is related to your setup during install. There are speciallized cd's for setting up a kde envirenment and others as well.

T 1326689008 18<26boudiccas>	zane; but that will only work /after/ bootup, i want to change them to read them on screen before logon and during bootup
T 1326689058 18<28zane>	boudiccas: there is a param u can change to do that
T 1326689066 18<28zane>	boudiccas: through grub i think
T 1326689096 18<26boudiccas>	zane; ah, now we're getting somewhere, any ideas what parameter and how to actually change it please?
T 1326689113 18<28zane>	boudiccas: you on squeeze?
T 1326689115 18<24acu_>	samgruger: first you need to know whether there are mounted and their names -  type mount -l   or some other fdisk -l  from GUI there are tools - I know in gnome there is a disk utility - graphic and easy to manage
T 1326689119 18<26boudiccas>	zane; yes
T 1326689128 18<28zane>	acu_: any ideas about the dhcpd ?
T 1326689143 18<19Alazare619>	does anyone here use x11vnc and have a init.d script for it so it can run 24/7
T 1326689168 18<24acu_>	zane: I think you have another dchp server in the network - do you have a router wifi in the home or wherever you are - how are you connecting now to internet
T 1326689214 18<24acu_>	the message is strange - I know one thing - if you have two dchp servers with same subnet they shutoff each other -
T 1326689235 18<24acu_>	though the message is eth0  not configured is weird too
T 1326689251 18<24acu_>	if you do ifdown eth0
T 1326689264 18<28zane>	acu_: i am connected to internet via wlan0 and i do have a router on eth0 but DHCP is turned off on the router
T 1326689270 18<24simonlnu>	unless one can be made authoritative
T 1326689277 18<28zane>	acu_: the DHCP on wlan0 is the problem?
T 1326689289 18<28zane>	acu_: but the connections aren't bridged?
T 1326689293 18<27Rusty1>	would route -n  tell?
T 1326689302 18<24simonlnu>	but then if it's being used for your internet connection, you have a slight problem ;)
T 1326689307 18<24acu_>	zane: of course - usually comercial DCHPs have 192.168.0.1 as default address
T 1326689309 18<19Alazare619>	im looking for help with init.d x11vnc as a service prior to login/ie lightdm login screen and then once loged in reaccept connections
T 1326689346 18<28zane>	acu_: so i need to change the address in interface and dhcpd.conf ?
T 1326689412 18<24acu_>	zane: first you should make sure that you assign to eth0 an address not in the dhcp pool of your wireless router - and anyhow having two dhcp in the same subnet will collide - rogue dhcps
T 1326689442 18<24acu_>	but yes - change the ip address of eth0 zane
T 1326689460 18<28zane>	acu_: ok let me try
T 1326689666 22*	langkid1 is now known as langkid1|Away
T 1326689676 18<24acu_>	samgruer there is a disk utility in gnome - very nice and easy to see and mount the hard disks - GUI - did you find it ?
T 1326689687 18<24acu_>	I know xfce has something like this too
T 1326689722 18<26boudiccas>	where do I change the file output of the boot screen messages that scroll by so fast and are so small as to be unreadable before you get to the logon screen please? i want to make them bigger and brighter so that they are readable, like in RHEL, Fedora or Centos. this is during bootup and before the logon screen, and so far there is a parameter in grub which controls this, but what is it and how do i access it please?
T 1326689781 18<24acu_>	zane: I have to go, anyhow if you type on you browser 192.168.0.1 your router will popup most probably - or you can look at the back of your router/wifi - they tell you the default IP
T 1326689842 18<24bfig>	is there anything i should take into account if i want to install the 32 bit compatibility libraries?
T 1326689854 18<24acu_>	I think that is your problem - you have set your eth0 with the same IP as your comercial router - I would change your subnet like 192.168.22.something
T 1326689944 18<24acu_>	bfig: whatfor are  you installing them - what do you run ? Squeeze or Wheezy ? If I install skype I think it pulls 32 bit compat libs - with no problems - but I do not know details - I know it wors
T 1326689961 18<24bfig>	acu, wheezy
T 1326689976 18<24bfig>	i want to run dwarf fortress. so far i've been using a 32 bit chroot but it is not working as i expected
T 1326689986 18<24bfig>	ie, crashes a lot etc
T 1326689994 18<24acu_>	I mean if I run Wheezy AMD64 and install skype - or teamviewer - forgot which one - 64 bit - with Gdebiinstaller it pulls all the dependencies
T 1326690023 18<24acu_>	for me teamviewer works fine and so does skype in wheezy -
T 1326690096 18<28zane>	acu_: lost internet on wlan0, had to unplug cable on eth0 for some reason?
T 1326690110 18<28zane>	dhcpd wouldn't start either way
T 1326690127 18<28zane>	now it's complaining about a bad subnet netmask combination
T 1326690133 18<24bfig>	i need the 32 bit version of a library, how can i download it?
T 1326690152 18<24acu_>	zane: I just wrote something
T 1326690153 18<24bfig>	(using the package manager and without messing up the current 64 bit version)
T 1326690157 18<28zane>	i changed the static ip of eth0 to 192.168.2.1
T 1326690158 18<24acu_>	I think that is your problem - you have set your eth0 with the same IP as your comercial router - I would change your subnet like 192.168.22.something
T 1326690181 18<28zane>	acu_: i changed it to 192.168.2.something
T 1326690201 18<24acu_>	yes but there are few places need cleaning -
T 1326690208 18<28zane>	acu_: can i use 10.10.0.1 ?
T 1326690211 18<28zane>	acu_:  what?
T 1326690213 18<24acu_>	perhaps
T 1326690227 18<24acu_>	there are some caches somewhere
T 1326690240 18<28zane>	acu_: what do u mean? caches?
