T 1326637444 18<20kwtm>	Also, does pathogen#infect() have to be in .vimrc, or can it be in a sourced file called from .vimrc?  I have the latter.
T 1326637466 18<20kwtm>	bairui: Ah, so I don't need the plugin indent.  Thx.

T 1326637494 18<20kwtm>	What does the filetype line do?  Anyway, I have it ... and it's still acting funny.  Maybe it's just the one plugin I tried...
T 1326637511 18<27bairui>	kwtm: does your copy of pathogen have the   infect()   function?
T 1326637532 18<27bairui>	kwtm: that filetype line is what enables plugins and indent scripts in Vim
T 1326637559 18<20kwtm>	bairui: Yes, I even managed to manually type  :pathogen#infect()   and it worked (well, gave no errors)

T 1326637689 18<20kwtm>	So, to clarify: if I test it now by moving a plugin previously in vimfiles\plugin into vimfiles\bundle\yankring\plugin , I can re-initialize by calling  :call pathogen#infect()  and it should now recognize the new location of the plugin, right?
T 1326637706 18<20kwtm>	Although I guess the old plugin is still working so I can't identify a failure from that ...

T 1326637910 18<20kwtm>	So :call pathogen#infect()  will get it to re-look for new plugins and new helptags, right?

T 1326638197 18<27bairui>	kwtm: are you restarting vim every time you do surgery on the plugin layout? you should. just calling pathogen#infect() again is probably not a good thing.
T 1326638219 18<20kwtm>	bairui: Not necessarily every time, but this particular time I did.

T 1326662324 18<24johnhamelink>	AnarchoTroll I guess it depends what you use vim for!
T 1326662348 18<24johnhamelink>	AnarchoTroll for example, if you plan on using it as an IDE it makes sense to trick out your vimrc because it's personal to you

T 1326677066 18<19un214>	I have a very hard time believing there can be any security implications in modeline
T 1326677077 18<25jamessan>	there have been. check Vim's CVEs
T 1326677229 18<19un214>	hmmm it shows one involving feedkeys that looks long patched
T 1326677345 18<19un214>	do you have any idea how hard this thing is to google when you don't know its name
T 1326677355 18<19un214>	I didn't until today and I've been using it for years
T 1326677532 18<25jamessan>	the problem is that Vim blacklists options from being set in modelines.  so, if Bram didn't think of an attack that the option could expose or there's a bug in the implementation of one of the options (like there used to be in 'spellfile') then editing a file from a malicious user is a problem
T 1326677575 18<25jamessan>	it'd be better to whitelist only the subset of options that have been properly audited and make sense to be used in modelines.  the securemodelines plugins helps with the second half of that
T 1326677600 18<24strull>	wouldn't it be enought to disable it for root only?
T 1326677642 18<25jamessan>	why should root be the only one protected?
T 1326677678 18<25jamessan>	Vim does disable it for root, by default
T 1326677682 18<19un214>	the only ones I know a good use for are ts,sw,bom
T 1326677711 18<24strull>	I rarely use it anyway. And if so for 'ft
T 1326677871 18<24strull>	vim's default looks like a good compromise to me - maybe because I'm not the overly paranoic
T 1326677920 18<19any-key>	I'm a big fan of the IR_black colorscheme, but it doesn't work well outside of gvim so I used one of those converters to get it to work
T 1326677927 18<19un214>	a smarter move would be to only allow the ones that are essentially properties of the document
T 1326677939 18<19any-key>	which turned out great, except in visual mode selecting text causes the highlighting to disappear
T 1326677947 18<19any-key>	the offending color scheme is here: https://github.com/eric-wood/dotfiles/blob/master/.vim/colors/ir_black_term.vim
T 1326677949 18<25jamessan>	I'd prefer not to let someone execute an arbitrary command in my home directory just because I opened a file :)
T 1326677958 18<25jamessan>	call that paranoia if you like
T 1326677963 18<25jamessan>	un214: agreed
T 1326677996 18<24strull>	jamessan: As I see it, there is no way to do so. Could you paste an example?
T 1326678011 18<22const>	jamessan: it isn't an arbitrary command
T 1326678036 18<25jamessan>	strull: there isn't currently, no.  there has been before and due to the way Bram handles modelines, it may happen again
T 1326678039 18<22const>	but... there have been security issues with ml in the past
T 1326678040 18<24strull>	jamessan: no offense meant, btw. Really
T 1326678047 18<25jamessan>	I should say, is currently a known way
T 1326678059 18<19any-key>	setting ctermfg=fg *should* preserve syntax highlighting, right?
T 1326678072 18<25jamessan>	er, isn't
T 1326678159 18<25jamessan>	the spellfile problem at least only let a modeline try to allocate an exceedingly large amount of memory
T 1326678409 18<19un214>	looking through the list, I'd say these are obviously safe: aleph (only if UTF-8 tty), autoindent, binary, breakat, fillcol, joinspaces, linebreak, linewrap, newline, paragraphs, shiftwidths, startofline, tabinsert, tabstop, wrapmargin, wrapwords, wrapscreen
T 1326678433 18<19un214>	jamessan: I can imagine a possible attack vector using spellfile
T 1326678440 18<19un214>	say: spellfile=/etc/shadow
T 1326678470 18<19un214>	or worse: /dev/rmt0
T 1326679447 18<20AnarchoTroll>	is there shortcut to return to the previously opened buffer?
T 1326679460 18<20AnarchoTroll>	bp actually returns to the previous one on the list
T 1326679468 18<25jamessan>	<C-^> (or <C-6> on some keyboards)
T 1326679514 18<20AnarchoTroll>	let me try
T 1326679537 18<20AnarchoTroll>	awesome

T 1326681530 18<20thepro4ever>	one thing i hate about autocompletion in vim is when it brings up the autocomplete options its a drop down list for which i have to use the arrow keys, i can't just use 'k' or 'j' to scroll up and down that list like i do while i'm coding
T 1326681593 18<24strull>	thepro4ever: try ctrl-n and ctrl-p
T 1326681619 18<20thepro4ever>	thats two additional key presses

T 1326681812 18<27bairui>	thepro4ever: you could play with:  inoremap <expr> j pumvisible() ? "\<c-n>" : 'j'      and the k analogue
T 1326682036 18<24frogonwheels>	thepro4ever: I guess the problem wth that is that often when the autocomplete is dropped down, you can still insert more characters to narrow down the options.
T 1326682066 18<20thepro4ever>	if i type another character the list disappears
T 1326682091 18<20thepro4ever>	you're an amish fag
T 1326682095 18<20thepro4ever>	woops sorry

T 1326684495 18<27briandoll>	I'm writing a function in vimscript where I call execute with "normal ci[" (example) to change the text object.  It works, but leaves vim in normal mode, not input mode, as typing :ci[ would do.
T 1326684562 18<27bairui>	briandoll: :help :startinsert
T 1326684679 18<27briandoll>	thanks!  That does seem to work, but I'm not understanding why it's necessary.  Does a function run in some sort of sub-buffer or something?
T 1326684706 18<27bairui>	for want of a better explanation: yes
T 1326684830 18<27briandoll>	ok, thanks
T 1326684840 18<27bairui>	for example, briandoll, create a test function with several normal mode inserts (separate statements); call the function, see the inserts; press u to undo - they all disappear at once.

T 1326685086 18<27bairui>	I am talking about gamifying (yes, i know, groan) Deliberate Practice
T 1326685100 18<27bairui>	both words in DP are offputting right from the start
T 1326685166 18<27bairui>	I have an idea for an area where budding vimmers can practice their craft in a fun, competitive, peer assessed way.
T 1326685171 18<27briandoll>	If you haven't read it, "The Talent Code" is an awesome book on that idea.
T 1326685181 18<27hypnocat>	there's already vimgolf
T 1326685182 18<27bairui>	thanks, i'll look it up
T 1326685191 18<27hypnocat>	but, imo, there should be something more action-oriented
T 1326685191 18<27bairui>	vimgolf is ok, but not all that
T 1326685195 18<27hypnocat>	sort of like head-to-head tetris
T 1326685197 18<27hypnocat>	but with vim
T 1326685210 18<27hypnocat>	maybe you have a bit of text on the bottom of your side of the screen
T 1326685214 18<27hypnocat>	and blocks of text fall
T 1326685215 18<20kwtm>	vimgolf is more focused on keystroke economy, but I think it would be nice to have something based on time.
T 1326685224 18<27hypnocat>	you have to turn your text at the bottom in to one of the falling blocks
T 1326685239 18<20kwtm>	E.g. "How many seconds does it take you to produce twelve lines with twelve consecutive integers starting with 5?"  etc.
T 1326685240 18*	27bairui takes notes :)
T 1326685243 18<27hypnocat>	when you do it in time, the block snaps in to place..
T 1326685261 18<27hypnocat>	or maybe something like missile command
T 1326685270 18<27hypnocat>	where the "asteroids" of text are bombing your city
T 1326685283 18<27bairui>	for me, kwtm,   :call List(5,5)     :)
T 1326685288 18<27hypnocat>	and you have to shoot them down by converting your text to match the falling asteroids
T 1326685310 18<20kwtm>	bairui: Yeah, but do you take 5 minutes to type that in?  (Who knows, maybe you have cerebral palsy and you use a head stick to type?)
T 1326685340 18<27bairui>	then I should have a way to let others in the game know my handicap to level the playing field
T 1326685390 18<27hypnocat>	an easy way to handicap is to give the stronger side less points for a successful move
T 1326685405 18<27hypnocat>	another way is to give the stronger side less time
T 1326685436 18<27bairui>	both sound good
T 1326685471 18<27hypnocat>	the more challenging thing is how to make the game fun for more than a few minutes

T 1326685495 18<27bairui>	ok, so, this will all be in my article, but my thoughts were two-fold
T 1326685532 18<27bairui>	1. have the players create a new thing ever day - a new map, macro, function... something. (this has pitfalls and is easy to game (cheat))
T 1326685571 18<27bairui>	2. have a challenge that users need to solve. the solutions can be verified automatically, but are also peer assessed in terms of beauty / etc.
T 1326685999 18<29pen>	I don't like how it is currently handled for tex files, the syntax highlighting sucks
T 1326686019 18<29pen>	I wonder if this is an old version of it because I have a valid syntax yet the coloring are all messed up
T 1326686034 18<27hypnocat>	pen: try a different colorscheme
T 1326686047 18<27hypnocat>	bairui: that sounds like a good idea

T 1326687351 18<29pen>	and :set ft return tex
T 1326687355 18<29pen>	nice
T 1326687356 18<27hypnocat>	great
T 1326687361 18<29pen>	I guess this is a bug
T 1326687365 18<27hypnocat>	dunno
T 1326687366 18<29pen>	for vim
T 1326687374 18<27hypnocat>	or for macvim weirdness
T 1326687387 18<29pen>	hmm
T 1326687408 18<27hypnocat>	i don't really know anything about macs or macvim
T 1326687419 18<27hypnocat>	not that i'd know what the source was if it was on linux either..
T 1326687424 18<29pen>	but macvim uses vim from official repo I guess
T 1326687432 18<27hypnocat>	to track down the real reason for this will take someone more knowledgable in vim than i
T 1326687437 18<29pen>	oh
T 1326687437 18<29pen>	lol
T 1326687449 18<29pen>	you are already very knowledgable in vim
T 1326687451 18<29pen>	I can tell
T 1326687451 22*	s0ra_h is now known as sora_h
T 1326687465 18<27hypnocat>	i get by, for the most part..
T 1326687466 18<29pen>	but
T 1326687468 18<29pen>	oh
T 1326687477 18<29pen>	have you tried to reproduce it on your machine
T 1326687486 18<29pen>	I wonder if that is true across platform
T 1326687488 18<29pen>	or only macvim
T 1326687490 18<29pen>	or vim on mac
T 1326687491 18<27hypnocat>	well, tex is detected properly on my machine
T 1326687496 18<27hypnocat>	so don't know how to reproduce the problem
T 1326687497 18<29pen>	hmm, weird
T 1326687519 18<27hypnocat>	i don't need a ~/.vim/ftdetect/tex.vim file to fix vim's tex detection
T 1326687523 18<29pen>	my vim is at 7.3.353
T 1326687523 18<27hypnocat>	because it works fine out of the box
T 1326687530 18<29pen>	hmm
T 1326687536 18<27hypnocat>	mine's 7.3.266
T 1326687543 18<27hypnocat>	on gentoo linux
T 1326687558 18<29pen>	hm
T 1326687575 18<27hypnocat>	well.. in any case, now that it works for you, you don't really have to worry about this
T 1326687588 18<27hypnocat>	unless you are serious about tracking down the bug for some reason
T 1326687609 18<27hypnocat>	in which case, you might want to try asking about it in here tomorrow morning, when more people are awake
T 1326687632 18<29pen>	hm, ok
T 1326687636 18<29pen>	i'm just curious
T 1326687640 18<29pen>	not serioua
T 1326687645 18<27hypnocat>	i'm curious too
T 1326687651 18<27hypnocat>	it would be good to know what's causing this
T 1326687657 18<29pen>	yea
T 1326687691 18<29pen>	btw, I rename ftdetect to ftdetect-testing, would that make it ineffective temporarily?
T 1326687694 18<29pen>	I want to do some testing
T 1326687699 18<29pen>	for finding the cause
T 1326687759 18<27hypnocat>	what i'd do instead is create an ~/.vim/ftdetect.old and "mv ~/.vim/ftdetect/tex.vim ~/.vim/ftdetect.old"
T 1326687774 18<29pen>	weird
T 1326687782 18<29pen>	this is weird, lol
T 1326687787 18<29pen>	now even without ftdetect
T 1326687797 18<29pen>	it is normal now, no plaintex
T 1326687801 18<27hypnocat>	that is weird
T 1326687808 18<27hypnocat>	could you type :verbose set ft?
T 1326687822 18<29pen>	yea, now it is tex
T 1326687828 18<27hypnocat>	but where from?
T 1326687829 18<29pen>	I move ftdetect folder out of .vim
T 1326687843 18<29pen>	the same file in the screenshot
T 1326687844 18<27hypnocat>	the :verbose set ft?    should tell you where the setting came from
T 1326687847 18<29pen>	oh
T 1326687851 18<29pen>	oops, I only type set ft
T 1326687864 18<29pen>	from the same place
T 1326687867 18<29pen>	macvim
T 1326687875 18<27hypnocat>	same exact file?
T 1326687875 18<29pen>	  filetype=tex
T 1326687875 18<29pen>	        Last set from /usr/local/Cellar/macvim/7.3-63/MacVim.app/Contents/Resources/vim/runtime/filetype.vim
T 1326687879 18<27hypnocat>	very weird
T 1326687888 18<27hypnocat>	i don't know why it would change to tex
T 1326687900 18<27hypnocat>	are you sure you no longer have a ~/.vim/ftdetect/tex.vim ?
T 1326687903 18<29pen>	it's like that fix correct the internal state somehow
T 1326687905 18<29pen>	yea
T 1326687909 18<27hypnocat>	bizarre
T 1326687913 18<29pen>	I removed it, and move it outside .vim
T 1326687928 18<29pen>	then restart vim of course
T 1326687933 18<27hypnocat>	do you happen to own any gremlins?
T 1326687950 18<29pen>	weird
T 1326687952 18<29pen>	lol
T 1326687969 18<29pen>	who knows
T 1326687970 18<27hypnocat>	well.. now you know how to fix it if it happens again
T 1326687972 18<29pen>	but this is interesting
T 1326687993 18<29pen>	yea, could you explain the line for me plz?
T 1326688006 18<29pen>	so next time I can fix it for other filetype
T 1326688025 18<29pen>	if what you are saying is true :P
T 1326688048 18<27hypnocat>	try :help new-filetype
T 1326688053 18<27hypnocat>	there's a good explanation in there
T 1326688091 18<27hypnocat>	also, see :help :autocmd
T 1326688107 18<29pen>	ok
T 1326688108 18<29pen>	thanks
T 1326688125 18<27hypnocat>	and :help autocmd-events
T 1326688205 18<29pen>	hypnocat: btw
T 1326688207 18<29pen>	small question
T 1326688214 18<27hypnocat>	sure
T 1326688238 18<29pen>	in your tex file, if  you type "5 in" in normal text, would that give you some weird highlighting?
T 1326688252 18<29pen>	as if it thought it means inches
T 1326688290 18<27hypnocat>	if you use that F9 mapping on it i gave you earlier, you should see the highlight group it uses
T 1326688329 18<27hypnocat>	what i see on mine is:  hi<texLength> trans<texLength> lo<Number>
T 1326688339 18<27hypnocat>	so i guess the tex syntax file is picking it up as a length
T 1326688365 18<29pen>	yea, then that's a bug
T 1326689257 18<27briandoll>	Released! My first tiny vim plugin: change-container.vim https://github.com/briandoll/change-container.vim/
T 1326689285 18<27briandoll>	thanks for the help, folks!  i'm a vimscript noob, so feedback on style/efficiency welcome
T 1326689387 18<27mattly_>	briandoll: what's the win of this over surround.vim ?
T 1326689405 18<27briandoll>	they do different things
T 1326689451 18<27briandoll>	change-container.vim gives you a single command to change the contents of the "container" as defined by various chars (brackets, etc.)
T 1326689458 18<27mattly_>	your examples all show things I've been doing with surround for some time
T 1326689505 18<27briandoll>	i read through that plugin (love all the tpope stuff) and didn't see how you could change the contents, though… enlighten me?
T 1326689539 18<27briandoll>	eg. I thought surround.vim allows you to change the "surroundings" themselves, not the contents within them
T 1326689548 18<27mattly_>	just replicated the "ci{", "ci[" and 'ci"' examples in my own vim, not sure if that's surround or something else
T 1326689560 18<27mattly_>	and "cit" is something that ragtag.vim does
T 1326689581 18<27briandoll>	ohhh… i'm sorry, my readme may not be clear… all of those examples are regular vim
T 1326689596 18<27briandoll>	that's standard vim stuff… my plugin provides a single command that works in all those scenarios
T 1326689610 18<27mattly_>	oh
T 1326689616 18*	27mattly_ reads the readme a bit more
T 1326689626 18<27mattly_>	"removes the contents of the innermost container"
T 1326689648 18<27mattly_>	I tend to do, f.e.: cs'"
T 1326689661 18<27mattly_>	or: ds'
T 1326689682 18<27mattly_>	with surround
T 1326689741 18<27mattly_>	I like explicitly declaring which surrounding thing I'm changing/deleting, since I may not be clear on what vim or a plugin considers to be a surrounding thing
T 1326689752 18<27mattly_>	f.e. backticks or pipes
T 1326689813 18<27briandoll>	yea, I totally get that.  i liked the idea of a single command, and i wanted an excuse to write my first plugin :)
T 1326689831 18<27mattly_>	ah, cool
T 1326689850 18<27briandoll>	surround.vim doesn't do this, though.  I considered forking it and adding this feature, but I'll wait until I have more of a clue :)
T 1326689855 18<27mattly_>	I'd put some time into emphasizing what distinguishes your plugin, then
T 1326689871 18<27briandoll>	surround.vim makes it easier to change the "surroundings" themselves, not the contents within them
T 1326689909 18<27mattly_>	right, but like I said, more often than not I want to explicitly declare which surroundings I care about
T 1326689929 18<27mattly_>	if you don't, then your plugin would grease the wheels
T 1326690031 18<27hypnocat>	what's the command to update documentation from all the ~/.vim/doc/* files?
T 1326690056 18<27mattly_>	hypnocat: :helptags *path*
T 1326690065 18<27hypnocat>	helptags.. right.. right
T 1326690066 18<27hypnocat>	thanks
T 1326690070 18<27bairui>	two things, briandoll - 1: you should use   normal!   instead of   normal   and 2: you don't need to use execute with startinsert
T 1326690104 18*	27briandoll reads up on those two things some more :)
T 1326690198 18<27bairui>	also, it's all good and well providing a command to access your <sid> function, but if you think nobody is going to run it that way and you only created it to have something for the map to use, consider using <sid> in your map instead. Also read   :help <plug   for extra bonus points. :)
T 1326690235 18<27bairui>	ah, that reminds me... i've been meaning to write a How To Write Your First Vim Plugin article for a while now too...
T 1326690570 18<27briandoll>	I'm reading about <sid> but I'm not clear where it goes.  on the "command" line or the "nmap" line or both?
T 1326690591 18<27briandoll>	also, i'm renaming it to change-inside-surroundings.vim  verbose but more explicit :)
