T 1304015270 18<28shintaku>	i'm saying that this is also the default behavior of the terminals for each operating system you mentioned
T 1304015287 18<28shintaku>	the behavior you see in vim matches that of the terminal on the underlying OS
T 1304015410 18<27fifou>	i'm not sure it is related to the command "cd"... I think this is an other reason... Why can't we deplace focus to $HOME dir on windows with :cd ? There must be a reason.

T 1304016308 18<28shintaku>	that was fast.  maybe they just do it to be consistent with the default behavior of Windows.  not sure why Windows chose to do this
T 1304016327 18<28shintaku>	maybe cause they have no pwd

T 1304016428 18<27fifou>	shintaku: that could be but vim know $HOME (in command line or in vim script context... So it must know home dir and :cd to it automaticaly ?

T 1304016652 18<29Endiannes>	jrdavid, I guess its a bit vague in abstract, in essense, my situation is something like... [cursor here]struct foo \n{ \nfunction\n{\nmorebraces\n{\n}\n}\n anotherfunction{} }; the command should delete everything after the cursor till the last "}" which matches the first "{" encountered
T 1304016674 18<27fifou>	on a fr keyboard, for example, you have to do CTRL-6 by doing CTRL-^ using ALT GR key

T 1304020962 18<27fifou>	I don't understand the need of :echo command
T 1304021015 18<20graywh>	fifou, echos the result of delete() 0=success
T 1304021018 18<24jzaksh>	jrdavid: i'm a bit confused (obviously) - the highlight statemnt manages to still run, when i open a *.txt file -- but the wrapping `if` doesnt seem to detect the file is a txt file -- so you're suggesting that file detection *may* not run? -- could someone suggest why/when it would/wouldn't run?
T 1304021057 18<24deryni>	jzaksh: You want that snippet to run after filetypes have been set, your vimrc may or may not run then and will not be run for subsequent files.
T 1304021097 18<24jzaksh>	deryni: that snippet is the last thing to run in my ~/.vimrc
T 1304021111 18<24deryni>	Is txt even an ft vim has?
T 1304021123 18<20graywh>	txt isn't a normal filetype
T 1304021127 18<24jzaksh>	aaah
T 1304021129 18<24deryni>	jzaksh: That isn't really relevant to the point.
T 1304021130 18<27fifou>	graywh: what is the goal of this?
T 1304021154 18<24jzaksh>	deryni: oh, i thought you just said "you want that snippet to run _after_"
T 1304021159 18<24deryni>	jzaksh: The point is that vimrc running time isn't the time you want to be doing that for it to work in general.
T 1304021168 18<24jzaksh>	okay
T 1304021171 18<20graywh>	and filetype won't be set when vimrc loads, so '' != 'txt evaluates to true
T 1304021225 18<24jzaksh>	okay. well, to be more clear, i actually just want to say, "if file extension is *.txt" -- should i even be doing this through vim's "file type" ?
T 1304021254 18<27fifou>	graywh: i mean, we don't need this echo even if it prints the return of delete function. Indeed, I do not see the print (command line too short or too quick, i don't know)
T 1304021326 18<22jrdavid>	jzaksh: whatever you want done for text files, put in a file called ~/.vim/ftplugin/txt.vim and have :au! BufEnter *.txt set ft=txt in your vimrc
T 1304021359 18<20graywh>	jzaksh, he wants it for non-*.txt files
T 1304021403 18<24jzaksh>	i mean. high level goal is to (maybe for another day) turn off a lot of programming-specific settings, when I'm editing a plain text file.
T 1304021436 18<20graywh>	programming-specific?
T 1304021442 18<24jzaksh>	so, as I've made clear, my approach to the solution may be way too uninformed
T 1304021483 18<24jzaksh>	graywh: thats an arbitrary term, i would hand edit until I'm comfortable. but I would probably like to exclude syntax hilighting, redundant whitespace hilighting
T 1304021506 18<24jzaksh>	etc. until I feel like its comfortable editing a plain text file without pain

T 1304021832 18<24jzaksh>	graywh: so you don't suggest using the ~/.vim/ftplugin/ dir that jrdavid pointed out?
T 1304021901 18<20graywh>	it's wrong and doesn't solve your issue
T 1304021923 18<24jzaksh>	graywh: do you have a suggestion?
T 1304022128 18<25tablecat>	How does one add a script to vim? For instance the one found here: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Step_increment_and_replace
T 1304022163 18<20graywh>	put it in your vimrc or a file under .vim/plugin/
T 1304022194 18<25tablecat>	I tried pasting it in to a file at .vim/plugin/SReplace but no luck

T 1304022268 18<25tablecat>	Thanks, sorry for idiot question
T 1304022513 18<24jzaksh>	looking back at the conversation, I don't see an solution proposed, aside from the one graywh says won't work. Am I just reading over something? Or is there no simple solution to "do x if no *.txt file extension" ?
T 1304022627 18<20graywh>	you need to combine jrdavid's first example using :if with an autocmd
T 1304022916 18<19Araxia_>	doing a lot of html editing lately. any plugin recommendations? i'm going to try sparkup.vim
